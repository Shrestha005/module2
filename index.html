                <h2>My Heart Leaps Up</h2>
                <p>
                    My heart leaps up when I behold <br>
                    A rainbow in the sky: <br>
                    So was it when my life began; <br>
                    So is it now I am a man; <br>
                    So be it when I shall grow old, <br>
                    Or let me die! <br>
                    The Child is father of the Man; <br>
                    And I could wish my days to be <br>
                    Bound each to each by natural piety. <br>
                    <br>

                <h2>London, 1802 </h2>
                <p>
                    Milton! thou should’st be living at this hour: <br>
                    England hath need of thee: she is a fen <br>
                    Of stagnant waters: altar, sword and pen, <br>
                    Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower, <br>
                    Have forfeited their ancient English dower <br>
                    Of inward happiness. We are selfish men; <br>
                    Oh! raise us up, return to us again; <br>
                    And give us manners, virtue, freedom, power. <br>
                    Thy soul was like a Star, and dwelt apart: <br>
                    Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea: <br>
                    Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free, <br>
                    So didst thou travel on life’s common way, <br>
                    In cheerful godliness; and yet thy heart <br>
                    The lowliest duties on herself did lay. <br>
                    <br>
                    -by William Wordsworth <br>

                <h2>Desideria</h2>
                <p>
                    Surprized by joy — impatient as the wind — <br>
                    I turn’d to share the transport — O with whom <br>
                    But Thee — deep buried in the silent tomb, <br>
                    That spot which no vicissitude can find? <br>
                    <br>
                    Love, faithful love recall’d thee to my mind <br>
                    But how could I forget thee? Through what power <br>
                    Even for the least division of an hour <br>
                    Have I been so beguiled as to be blind <br>
                    <br>
                    To my most grievous loss — That thought’s return <br>
                    Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore, <br>
                    Save one, one only, when I stood forlorn, <br>
                    <br>
                    Knowing my heart’s best treasure was no more; <br>
                    That neither present time, nor years unborn <br>
                    Could to my sight that heavenly face restore. <br>
                    <br>
